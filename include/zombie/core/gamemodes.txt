Game modes decides which modules that are allowed in a certain game mode.

The game mode manager may automatically load and unload registered modules by
using ServerCommand and "sm plugins unload". If this doesn't work we'll have to
force modules to implement OnModuleEnable and OnModuleDisable events.

OnGameModeActivate
OnGameModeDeactivate

Modules should NOT do anything that modifies the game engine state before the
game mode is activated. This could be stuff like setting model, modifying entity
properties or cvars. They need to hook and wait for the OnGameModeActivate
event.
